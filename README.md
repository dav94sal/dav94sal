I'm a software developer with a background in music and Audio Visual (AV) technologies. My last project as an AV Technician was for Apple in Austin, TX. My team installed hundreds of AV systems ranging from simple conference rooms to high profile "War Rooms" and even a large cafeteria! I commissioned those same systems by programming amplifiers, speakers, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), and displays to verify the integrity of the systems installations. Going through this process fascinated me to the inner workings of the software I was using to program. So, I learned to code by studying Full Stack Web Development at App Academy, where I built multiple full stack projects with React and Redux in the frontend and Python or Javascript in the backend. I also love and studied music in college which has allowed me to not only work in many teams over many years but also exposed a natural mentor-like demeanor that often strengthened my teams. The next step in my carreer is to combine my curiosity of technology and passion for music by learning gaming engines and ultimately to write and implement music in video games.
